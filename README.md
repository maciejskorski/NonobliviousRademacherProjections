# Optimal Rademacher Projections
The repository associated with the paper "Non-Oblivious Performance of Rademacher Random Embeddings".

The results improve accuracy guarantees in a data-dependent (non-oblivious) way using majorization and Schur concavity.

The more spread out the input data, the more distorted are the embeddings.
